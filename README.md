HW 2

To start, I made a few improvements without testing since I didn't
see how to.  First, I changed all the internal variable names in 
the classes so that they were more descriptive.  Also, I broke the
single file from last week into three files: The first is the classes,
the second is the user interface (the cmd loop), and the third is 
the test file. The test file tests the classes and methods in the class
file, as I don't know how to interact with the input method from another
method.
